        [ When you start in the world of gaming, the first thing you want is to have a good PC that can run all the videogames you want, 
        but you don’t know where to start or what kind of things you need to have a good computer. It’s for that reason that we are here, 
        to find the best components to start in the world of gaming. For anyone who wants to know how to build their first gaming PC or who 
        loves technology, this is where you will find the information you need.]

      </ul>
      <h3>Components</h3>
      <p>
        [It is very important to know which components to use, since not all of them are compatible with each other, 
        you can have a very good ram memory, but if your processor is of very low capacity, 
        you will not take full advantage of it and you may have problems when executing the programs or videogames.
        One of the components to take into account is the motherboard along with the processor, both are essential for your PC to have excellent performance. 
        You can have the best graphics card but without a good motherboard and processor, 
        you will not be able to get the most out of your graphics card.]

      </ul>
      <h3>Peripherals</h3>
      <p>
        [Peripherals often go unnoticed or unimportant, but nothing is further from the truth and not only for gaming, 
        but also for the durability and comfort that they can provide. 
        Having good peripherals allows you to have one of the best experiences and enjoy every activity you want to do on your PC. 
        There are many types of keyboards, for each type of taste. There are membrane keyboards, mechanical keyboards, ergonomic keyboards,
        flexible keyboards, each one with different characteristics that accommodate the user's preferences. 
        The most used are membrane keyboards and mechanical keyboards, the latter are the most used in the gaming world.]
