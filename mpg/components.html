                <p>It is very important to know which components to use, since not all of them are compatible with each other, 
                    you can have a very good ram memory, but if your processor is of very low capacity, 
                    you will not take full advantage of it and you may have problems when executing the programs or videogames.
                    One of the components to take into account is the motherboard along with the processor, both are essential for your PC to have excellent performance. 
                    You can have the best graphics card but without a good motherboard and processor, 
                    you will not be able to get the most out of your graphics card.</p>

                <p>The RAM card is one of the key points to avoid having problems with your computer, 
                    it is as important as the processor, without the RAM card or without a good RAM it is impossible for your 
                    computer to perform certain actions at the same time. The RAM card is the intermediary between the processor 
                    and the hard drive. Like the graphics card, there is a wide variety of brands for RAM cards, keep in mind that 
                    the more RAM the greater the processor's reaction time to perform certain actions. If your RAM card is damaged, 
                    you may have a lot of computer problems, so it is very important that you buy good RAM and take good care of it.</p>
