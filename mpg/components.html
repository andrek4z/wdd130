                <p>It is very important to know which components to use, since not all of them are compatible with each other, 
                    you can have a very good ram memory, but if your processor is of very low capacity, 
                    you will not take full advantage of it and you may have problems when executing the programs or videogames.
                    One of the components to take into account is the motherboard along with the processor, both are essential for your PC to have excellent performance. 
                    You can have the best graphics card but without a good motherboard and processor, 
                    you will not be able to get the most out of your graphics card.</p>
